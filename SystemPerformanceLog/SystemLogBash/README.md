Wanting to improve on my data collection programming, while utilizing a Raspberry Pi with Debian GNU/Linux 11 Operating System, I want to automate the collection of the data. Once the data is collected, ssh from my remote Windows computer to the Raspberry Pi, locate the csv of collected data and download/copy the data remotely.

---
How we built it (your tech stack):
---
Raspberry Pi with Debian GNU/Linux 11 Operating System
Pycharm & VS Code with Python 3.12


---
Challenges we ran into:
---
Trying to get the code files to mesh with MenuMain
Trying to schedule the crontab -e file with command to execute the program at set times.
Trying to execute the program using Pycharm and in a separate IDE VS Code environment to simulate the Gitpod VS code environment prior to upload.

Accomplishments that we're proud of:
---
So far everything!

What we learned:
---
See the above challenges, those are only a fewâ€¦ what else?
