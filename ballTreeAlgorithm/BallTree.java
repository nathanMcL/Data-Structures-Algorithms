// A ball tree is a binary tree in which every node defines a D-dimensional ball containing a subset of the points
// to be searched.
// Each internal node of the tree partitions the data points into two disjoint sets which are associated
// with different balls.
// While the balls themselves may intersect,
// each point is assigned to one or the other ball in the partition according to its distance from the ball's center.
// Each leaf node in the tree defines a ball and enumerates all data points inside that ball.
//
//
// Base Case: If the input array D contains only a single point, the function creates a leaf node B containing
// this single point and returns B.
//
// Recursive Case: If there is more than one point:
//
// The program identifies the dimension c with the greatest spread among the points in D.
// The spread could be calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values along each dimension.
// It selects a central point p based on dimension c. Typically, this could be the median point when the points
// are sorted along dimension c.
// The set of points D is divided into two subsets L and R, where L contains points lying to the left (or less than)
// the central point's value along dimension c, and R contains points lying to the right (or greater than).
// It then creates a new node B, setting p as its pivot point.
// The function calls itself recursively to construct the left and right subtrees from the subsets L and R,
// and these subtrees are assigned as the children of B.
// It calculates the radius of B, which is the maximum distance from the pivot point p
// to any of the points in its children.

// Finally, it returns the node B.
// Constructing the Tree: The function will be called initially with the entire dataset D, and through recursion,
// it will build up the Ball Tree by splitting the dataset into smaller and smaller subsets until it reaches the base case.
//
// Output: The output of the function is the root node B of the constructed Ball Tree.
// This root node will have attributes such as pivot, child1, child2,
// and radius, which are set during the construction process.
