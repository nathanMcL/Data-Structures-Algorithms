// A sorted array of size n contains distinct integers between 1 and n + 1,
// with one element missing.
// Give an O(log n) algorithm to find the missing integer,
// without using any extra spaces

// Consider this Binary search method for finding the missing number
// Given the array is sorted with distinct integers ranging from 1 to n+1,
// the missing element will create a gap where the value at an index is not equal
// to the index plus one (considering a 1-based array).

// Better explanation: We have a findMissingNumber method that performs a binary search
// to find the missing number in a sorted array of distinct integers.
// If the missing number is not within the array (i.e., it's n + 1), the loop exits,
// and the last return statement handles this case by returning array.length + 1.
//
//This method runs in O(log n) time since it's using a binary search approach,
// and it does not require any extra space.
